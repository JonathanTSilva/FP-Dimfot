## About the Project

# FP-Dimfot
Created to document the Android application developed for the discipline of Mobile Computing (E8CPM) of the Electrical Engineering course at the Federal Institute of São Paulo, campus Sertãozinho.

DIMFOT is a software for sizing photovoltaic systems, containing panels and frequency inverters, which assist electrical engineers in the area in a solar energy project. As an initial interface, the application is presented and the option for creating a new project is made available; in the main interface, a project registration and technical data insertion are carried out so that the systems can be dimensioned and the project saved in the database. Finally, all projects already registered on the device are presented in a last interface.
The system calculates the number of boards and inverters depending on the user's needs, and points out data such as the board's power, total power generated by the dimensioned system and minimum and maximum inverter powers. As a differential of this for others in the market, there is a final interface that is easy to understand and view for end users.
